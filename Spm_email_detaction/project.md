## 🧠 About the Project

This project is a **Spam Email Detection System** built using **Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.
It allows users to **enter any email text** and checks whether the email is **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**.

The project demonstrates **real-world ML workflow**, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and live prediction.
